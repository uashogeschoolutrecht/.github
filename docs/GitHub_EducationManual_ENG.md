### How to Apply for GitHub Education (Teachers)

This document supports the application process for the "GitHub Education package for teachers." As a researcher at HU (Hogeschool Utrecht), you are also eligible to use this.

**NOTES:**  
It’s helpful to be connected to the HU network, as your location will also be verified during the application.  
You must also have two-factor authentication enabled for your GitHub account.

1. Go to [https://github.com/education](https://github.com/education).  
   <p align="center"><img width="50%" height="50%" src="https://github.com/uashogeschoolutrecht/.github/blob/main/images/github_ed_img/GitHub_edu_page.png"></p>

2. Log in with your GitHub account or create a new one (top right of the screen).  
   <p>
   **Note:** If you're creating a new account, use your HU email address — this is required to apply for GitHub Education.  
   Already have an account but used a personal email? Either create a new account with your HU email or link your HU email to your existing GitHub account.  
   If you link it, extra steps are required when applying for GitHub for Teachers.
   </p>

3. Choose **Teachers**, even if you are a researcher at HU. Then click on **"Join GitHub Education"**.

   </p>

4. You will now be redirected to a page like the one below. Click **"Start an Application"**.

   </p>

5. A new window will open like the one below. Check **"Teacher"**, and if you used your HU email, you can also click **"Select this school"**.  
   If you used a personal email to sign up, enter your HU email under **"What is your school email address?"**  
   <p align="center"><img width="50%" height="50%" src="https://github.com/uashogeschoolutrecht/.github/blob/main/images/github_ed_img/apply_popup.PNG"></p>

6. Now click the **Share Location** button. A popup like the one below will appear — click **"Allow"**.  
   <p align="center"><img width="50%" height="50%" src="https://github.com/uashogeschoolutrecht/.github/blob/main/images/github_ed_img/allow_location_popup.PNG"></p>

7. Now you can click **Continue**, as shown in the image below.  
   <p align="center"><img width="50%" height="50%" src="https://github.com/uashogeschoolutrecht/.github/blob/main/images/github_ed_img/continue_popup.PNG"></p>

8. The next window will open, as shown below. It's best to upload a copy of your employee ID card showing the HU logo and your name.  
   See the example image — **note that the name and card number have been removed in the sample.**  
   *The card number doesn't always seem to be required; it may depend on the photo quality.*

   </p>

9. Your application is now complete! You can immediately see whether it was successful, like in the image below.

10. If your application is rejected, follow the instructions provided in the rejection message.  
    Enabling two-factor authentication and adding your name to your profile is usually enough.
