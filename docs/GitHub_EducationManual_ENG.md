### How to Apply for GitHub Education (Teachers)
This document supports the application process for the "GitHub Education package for teachers." As a researcher at HU, you can also make use of this.<p>
<br><strong>NOTES:</strong><br> It is helpful to be connected to the HU network as your location will also be checked during the application process.<p></p><br> It is also necessary to have two-factor authentication enabled for your account. 
</p>
<br>
1. Go to https://github.com/education.

2. Log in with your GitHub account or create a new one (top right of the screen).
   <p>
    <br><strong>Note:</strong> If you are creating a new account, use your HU email address—this is required to apply for GitHub Education. 
    <br>Already have an account but used your private email? Either create a new account with your HU email address or link your HU email address to your ‘private’ GitHub account. If you link the address, additional steps will be needed to apply for GitHub for Teachers.
    </p>
3. Choose Teachers, even if you are a researcher at HU. Then click on <strong>"Join GitHub Education"</strong>.<p align="center"><img align="left"><img width="48%" height="48%" src="https://github.com/uashogeschoolutrecht/.github/blob/main/images/github_ed_img/pick_teacher_marked.PNG"></img><img align="right"><img width="48%" height="48%" src="https://github.com/uashogeschoolutrecht/.github/blob/main/images/github_ed_img/teacher_join.PNG"></img></p>

4. You are now redirected to a page similar to the one in the image below. Click on <strong>"Start an Application"</strong>.

<p align="center"><img width="50%" height="50%" src="https://github.com/uashogeschoolutrecht/.github/blob/main/images/github_ed_img/apply2.png"></p>
5. This will open a new window like the one below. Now check <strong>"Teacher"</strong> and if you used your HU email address you can also click <strong>Select this school</strong>.
<br> If you used your personal email address when creating a GitHub account, then enter your HU email address at <strong>What is your school email address?</strong>
   <p align="center"><img width="50%" height="50%" src="https://github.com/uashogeschoolutrecht/.github/blob/main/images/github_ed_img/apply_popup.PNG"></p>

8. This opens the next window, as shown in the image below. It’s best to upload a copy of your employee card with the HU logo & your name. See also the example image used in an application. <strong>Note: in the example the name and card number are removed.</strong><em> The card number doesn’t always seem to be necessary—this may depend on the quality of the photo.</em><p align="center"><img align="left"><img width="48%" height="48%" src="https://github.com/uashogeschoolutrecht/.github/blob/main/images/github_ed_img/id_check.png"></img><img align="right"><img width="48%" height="48%" src="https://github.com/uashogeschoolutrecht/.github/blob/main/images/github_ed_img/id_example_image.JPG"></img></p>
